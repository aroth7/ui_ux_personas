        This interface is the CVS self-checkout machine. It is trying to solve the problem of every customer having to wait in line for the
        in person checkout station, which usually only has 1-2 employees, as well as speed up the checkout process in general. To use it,
        one scans ites in front of the scanner, then places the scanned items on the gray bagging table. While doing this, the user interacts
        with many buttons on the red screen.

    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <img src="images/sally.jpeg" alt="empathy map of Stressed Sally" style="width: 75%">
    <p class="center_text lead">
        Stressed Sally is a college student. She is rushing between classes and is trying to buy a diet coke 
        and a protein bar between classes. Because Sally is stressed, she forgets to press the buttons in the 
        correct order, which causes the machine to glitch. Additionally, the scanner malfunctions while Sally 
        is using the machine, so she has to call the actual checkout person over for help. The Stressed Sally 
        persona represents users who get confused by all the different steps one must follow, as well as the 
        group of users who have to deal with the machine not working because she dealt with both of these issues 
        while checking out.

    <p class="center_text lead">
        Efficient Edward is a businessman who often has to stop at CVS on the way home to pick up one or two 
        items. He doesn’t personally face any problems with the interface; however, he does have to wait longer 
        than expected while the people in front of him struggle. The Efficient Edward persona represents the 
        group of users who use the machine effectively to purchase only one item and also don’t run into any 
        issues regarding the machine breaking.
